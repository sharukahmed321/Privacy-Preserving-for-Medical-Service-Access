			Abstract? An electronic health (e-health) record system is a novel application that will bring great convenience in healthcare. The privacy and security of the sensitive personal information are the major concerns of the users, which could hinder further development and widely adoption of the systems. The searchable encryption (SE) scheme is a technology to incorporate security protection and favorable operability functions together, which can play an important role in the e-health record system. In this paper, we introduce a novel cryptographic primitive named as Lightweight and Privacy-Preserving Medical Services Access for Healthcare Cloud proxy reencryption function (Re-dtPECK), which is a kind of a time-dependent SE scheme. It could enable patients to delegate partial access rights to others to operate search functions over their records in a limited time period. The length of the time period for the delegatee to search and decrypt the delegator?s encrypted documents can be controlled. Moreover, the delegatee could be automatically deprived of the access and search authority after a specified period of effective time. It can also support the conjunctive keywords search and resist the keyword guessing attacks. By the solution, only the designated tester is able to test the existence of certain keywords. We formulate a system model and a security model for the proposed Re-dtPECK scheme to show that it is an efficient scheme proved secure in the standard model. The comparison and extensive simulations demonstrate that it has a low computation and storage overhead.
